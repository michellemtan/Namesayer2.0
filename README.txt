-Namesayer-

Namesayer is a name pronounciation application created and designed by Michelle Tan. It has been designed to improve users' pronounciation of difficult names, an important skill in an increasingly multicultural world. The user interface has been implemented using JavaFX and SceneBuilder while the functionality utilises Bash Scripts, Java and ProcessBuilder.

-Getting Started-
To run the Namesayer application:
1. Open up a new terminal
2. Change your directory to where your jar file is located
3. Type in the following command "chmod 744 Tan_mtan264.jar"
4. Type in the following command "java -jar Tan_mtan264.jar"

The Namesayer application should now be open!

-Design-
The Namesayer application has been designed to be discrete and easy to use. The various panels of the application are adjustable, allowing the user to slide the panels and customise the screen to fit their purpose.

> Creations List Maximised
The panel to the right of the creations list can slide across. This causes the list of creations to expand, allowing users to easily see any long/complicated names.

> Creations List Concealed
The creations list can be covered for privacy, in the instance the user wants to be discrete and not reveal any names they are struggling to pronounce.

> Play/Delete Buttons Concealed
The play and delete buttons can slide close if the user is not interested in playing/deleting any creations.

-Features-
The Namesayer application has many features including the following:

> Create
Namesayer allows the user to make a "creation", a five-second .mp4 video displaying the name of creation accompanied by an audio recording of the name being pronounced by the user. The creation name is to only include alphabetical characters (case sensitive), digits, spaces, underscores and hyphens. These creations will be stored in the created /Creations folder, relative to your current workspace.

Note that the creation name cannot only consist of whitespaces or have any leading/trailing whitespaces for clarity.

> Overwrite
Namesayer allows the user to overwrite any creations.

Note that once you confirm overwriting a creation, it cannot be undone. This means if you overwrite a file and press cancel when recording, the previous file will no longer exist.

> Record
Namesayer allows the user to create audio recordings of how the name is pronounced. Users will have 5 seconds to record themselves saying the creation name. This process begins after the user presses the 'OK' button.

> Play
Namesayer allows the user to play any creation videos they wish. They can do this by selecting any listed creations and pressing the 'Play' button. The video will appear on the screen and will start playing.

> Delete
Namesayer allows the user to delete any creations they do not wish to keep. This is done by selecting a creation from the list and pressing the 'Delete' button. 

Note that any deletions cannot be undone.

-Other-
Please note that only .mp4 files will be included in the list of creations as these are the only compatible creation files. Do not add any other unknown files to the Creations folder as the application has been optimised to only handle .mp4 files in the Creation format.
